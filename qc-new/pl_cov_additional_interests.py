==================================================
🔴 CRITICAL EVIDENCE EXTRACTION RULES 🔴
==================================================

**YOU MUST FOLLOW THIS EXACT PROCESS FOR EACH ADDITIONAL INTEREST:**

**STEP 1: SEARCH**
- Scan the policy text below for the entity name
- Look in: Additional Insured schedules, Mortgagee clauses, Loss Payee sections, Endorsements
- Check both TESSERACT and PYMUPDF sources (one may be clearer than the other)
- Search thoroughly - the entity may appear in multiple locations

**STEP 2: LOCATE THE PAGE NUMBER**
- Find the PAGE marker in the text (e.g., "PAGE 143" or "PAGE 67")
- The page number MUST come from these PAGE markers - DO NOT INVENT OR GUESS
- If you see the entity but cannot find a clear PAGE marker nearby, search up/down in the text for the closest marker

**STEP 3: COPY EXACT TEXT (DO NOT PARAPHRASE)**
- Copy the text WORD-FOR-WORD from the policy - no changes, no summaries
- Include at least 15-30 words for proper context
- Include the label/header if present (e.g., "Additional Insured:", "Mortgagee:")
- DO NOT change, summarize, rephrase, or "clean up" ANY words

**STEP 4: VERIFY YOUR WORK BEFORE SUBMITTING**
Ask yourself these questions:
✓ Did I copy this text EXACTLY as written? (not paraphrased, not summarized)
✓ Is the page number from an actual PAGE marker I can see in the text below?
✓ Does the entity name appear in my copied text?
✓ Did I include enough context (15-30 words minimum)?
✓ Would someone be able to Ctrl+F and find this exact text on this page?

⛔ IF YOU CANNOT FIND THE ENTITY AFTER THOROUGH SEARCH:
- Return status: "NOT_FOUND"
- Set evidence: null
- Set policy_interest_name: null
- Set policy_interest_address: null
- Set policy_interest_type: null
- Set match_type: null
- DO NOT INVENT, GUESS, OR PARAPHRASE

==================================================
EVIDENCE EXAMPLES - STUDY THESE CAREFULLY
==================================================

Certificate Entity: "DGR HOLDING LLC"

✅ EXAMPLE 1 - EXCELLENT (Exact copy with full context):
"Name Of Person(s) Or Organization(s) (Additional Insured): DGR HOLDING LLC, 123 MAIN STREET, ATLANTA, GA 30303. Coverage applies per the terms of this endorsement. (PYMUPDF, Page 143)"

✅ EXAMPLE 2 - EXCELLENT (From schedule with context):
"SCHEDULE OF ADDITIONAL INSUREDS: 1. DGR HOLDING LLC - 123 MAIN ST - ATLANTA GA 30303 - BLANKET ADDITIONAL INSURED 2. ABC COMPANY (TESSERACT, Page 67)"

✅ EXAMPLE 3 - EXCELLENT (Mortgagee clause with surrounding text):
"Loss Payable Clause: Loss, if any, under this policy shall be payable to DGR HOLDING LLC, 123 Main Street, Atlanta, GA 30303 as mortgagee as interest may appear. (PYMUPDF, Page 89)"

✅ EXAMPLE 4 - GOOD (Endorsement with entity name):
"This endorsement modifies insurance provided under COMMERCIAL GENERAL LIABILITY COVERAGE FORM. Additional Insured: DGR HOLDING LLC (TESSERACT, Page 145)"

❌ EXAMPLE 1 - BAD (Paraphrased, not exact):
"The policy lists DGR Holding LLC as an additional insured on page 143"
PROBLEM: Paraphrased instead of word-for-word copy

❌ EXAMPLE 2 - BAD (Missing page number):
"Name Of Person(s) Or Organization(s) (Additional Insured): DGR HOLDING LLC"
PROBLEM: No page number provided

❌ EXAMPLE 3 - BAD (Invented page number):
"DGR HOLDING LLC appears as additional insured (Page 143)"
PROBLEM: Not a direct quote, page number may be invented, no actual text copied

❌ EXAMPLE 4 - BAD (Insufficient context):
"DGR HOLDING LLC (Page 143)"
PROBLEM: Too short, no context, can't verify what this refers to

❌ EXAMPLE 5 - BAD (Summarized):
"Additional insured entity is listed in the schedule on page 67"
PROBLEM: Summary instead of exact quote

==================================================
CONTEXT FROM CERTIFICATE
==================================================

- Insured Name: {insured_name}
- Policy Number: {policy_number}
- Location Address: {location_address}

==================================================
CERTIFICATE ENTITIES TO FIND IN POLICY
==================================================

{json.dumps(cert_interests, indent=2) if cert_interests else "[] (No additional interests on certificate)"}

For EACH entity above, you must:
1. Search for it in the policy text below
2. Copy the exact text where it appears (15-30 words minimum)
3. Note the page number from the PAGE marker
4. Note the OCR source (TESSERACT or PYMUPDF)

==================================================
EVIDENCE EXTRACTION CHECKLIST
==================================================

Before submitting each validation, verify:

**IF YOU FOUND THE ENTITY (STATUS = MATCH or MISMATCH):**
□ I copied the text WORD-FOR-WORD (no paraphrasing)
□ My copied text includes at least 15-30 words of context
□ The entity name appears in my copied text
□ I got the page number from a PAGE marker in the text
□ I noted the OCR source (TESSERACT or PYMUPDF)
□ I included the section label (e.g., "Additional Insured:", "Mortgagee:")
□ Someone could find this exact text by searching the policy

**IF YOU DID NOT FIND THE ENTITY (STATUS = NOT_FOUND):**
□ I searched thoroughly through all the filtered text
□ I checked both TESSERACT and PYMUPDF sections
□ I set all policy_* fields to null
□ I set evidence to null
□ I set match_type to null
□ I did NOT invent or guess any information

==================================================
POLICY TEXT (FILTERED - ADDITIONAL INTERESTS SECTIONS)
==================================================

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: This is a FILTERED extract containing ONLY pages mentioning additional interests.**

The text below contains TWO OCR extraction sources per page:
- **--- TESSERACT (Buffer=1) ---** sections
- **--- PYMUPDF (Buffer=0) ---** sections

Use whichever source is clearer for your evidence extraction.

**SEARCH THIS FILTERED TEXT CAREFULLY:**

{filtered_policy_text}

==================================================
SEARCH PATTERNS TO LOOK FOR
==================================================

Common patterns where additional interests appear:

1. **Endorsement schedules (MOST COMMON):**
   "Name Of Person(s) Or Organization(s) (Additional Insured):" [entity name on next lines]
   "Additional Insured:" [entity name]
   
2. **Standalone schedules:**
   "SCHEDULE OF ADDITIONAL INSUREDS"
   "MORTGAGEE HOLDERS"
   "LOSS PAYEE SCHEDULE"
   
3. **Mortgagee/Loss Payee clauses:**
   "Mortgagee:" [entity name and address]
   "Loss Payable to:" [entity name and address]
   
4. **Endorsement forms:**
   Look for "CG 20" forms or endorsements with additional insured language

==================================================
NAME MATCHING RULES
==================================================

- **EXACT MATCH**: Names identical (case-insensitive) → status: "MATCH", match_type: "EXACT"
- **NAME VARIATION**: Names similar but NOT identical → status: "MISMATCH", match_type: "NAME_VARIATION"
  Examples: "GOLDING" vs "HOLDING", "SMITH" vs "SMITHE" (OCR errors)
  Even if likely same entity, names don't match exactly = MISMATCH
- **NOT FOUND**: Entity not in policy after thorough search → status: "NOT_FOUND", all fields null

**CRITICAL:** "TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN" is NOT a valid additional interest

==================================================
OUTPUT FORMAT - FOLLOW EXACTLY
==================================================

==================================================
FINAL VERIFICATION BEFORE SUBMITTING
==================================================

For EACH validation, double-check:

**IF STATUS = "MATCH" OR "MISMATCH":**
✓ evidence contains EXACT copied text (not paraphrased)?
✓ evidence includes 15-30 words minimum?
✓ evidence includes page number from PAGE marker?
✓ evidence includes OCR source (TESSERACT or PYMUPDF)?
✓ policy_interest_name is filled in?
✓ I can find this exact text in the policy above if I search for it?

**IF STATUS = "NOT_FOUND":**
✓ evidence is null (not empty string)?
✓ policy_interest_name is null?
✓ policy_interest_address is null?
✓ policy_interest_type is null?
✓ match_type is null?
✓ I searched thoroughly before declaring NOT_FOUND?

**Remember: It's better to return NOT_FOUND than to hallucinate or guess.**
