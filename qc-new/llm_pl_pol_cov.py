==================================================
⛔⛔⛔ ANTI-HALLUCINATION RULES (READ FIRST) ⛔⛔⛔
==================================================

**IF YOU CANNOT FIND SOMETHING, RETURN null OR "Not Found" - DO NOT HALLUCINATE**

1. **WHEN SEARCHING FOR A COVERAGE:**
   - Search thoroughly through all pages
   - If you CANNOT find it after careful search, return status="NOT_FOUND"
   - Return null for evidence_declarations and evidence_endorsements
   - Return null for all policy_* fields (policy_value, policy_name, etc.)
   - NEVER invent text or values that don't exist

2. **WHEN YOU FIND A COVERAGE BUT CAN'T FIND ITS VALUE:**
   - Return status="NOT_FOUND"
   - Return null for the value fields
   - Explain in notes: "Coverage name found but specific value/limit not located in policy"

3. **WHEN YOU PARTIALLY FIND SOMETHING:**
   - Example: You find "Building" mentioned but can't find the actual dollar limit
   - Return status="NOT_FOUND" with explanation in notes
   - Better to return NOT_FOUND than to guess a number

4. **CRITICAL - NEVER GUESS:**
   - Do NOT estimate values
   - Do NOT use "typical" amounts
   - Do NOT use numbers from other sections
   - If unclear, return null and NOT_FOUND

5. **EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS:**
   - Evidence MUST be verbatim text from the policy
   - Evidence MUST contain BOTH the coverage name AND the value
   - If you can't find evidence with both, return null
   - ONLY cite page numbers that are clearly marked in the policy

**When in doubt, return NOT_FOUND with null values. This is better than hallucinating.**

POLICY DOCUMENT (DUAL OCR SOURCES)
==================================================

This policy document contains TWO OCR extraction sources per page:
- **TESSERACT (Buffer=1)** - First OCR source
- **PYMUPDF (Buffer=0)** - Second OCR source

Use whichever source is clearer. ALWAYS cite which OCR source you used.

{policy_text}

==================================================
VALIDATION PROCESS
==================================================

For EACH Building coverage in the certificate:

**STEP 1: UNDERSTAND THE CERTIFICATE STRUCTURE**
- Is this a single building or multiple buildings?
- What is the location address? (Use this to match the right building in policy)
- What are the building names/numbers?

**STEP 2: SEARCH POLICY FOR BUILDING LIMITS**
- Look in the DECLARATIONS section (usually pages 1-10)
- Find the section labeled "Building" or "Coverages Provided"
- Match to the correct building using:
  * Location address
  * Premises number
  * Building number
  * Description

**STEP 3: CHECK FOR ENDORSEMENTS**
- Scan the ENTIRE policy for endorsements that modify building limits
- Look for forms like:
  * "BUILDING COVERAGE ENDORSEMENT"
  * "LIMIT OF INSURANCE - BUILDING"
  * Any amendment or correction forms
- Check effective dates of endorsements

**STEP 4: DETERMINE FINAL VALUE**
- What is the base limit in declarations?
- Are there any endorsements that increase/decrease the limit?
- What is the FINAL, EFFECTIVE limit for the building?

**STEP 5: COMPARE VALUES**
- Does the policy limit match the certificate limit?
- Handle dollar formatting differences: "$1,320,000" = "1,320,000" = "$1.32M"
- Consider:
  * Exact match = MATCH
  * Different value = MISMATCH
  * Not found in policy = NOT_FOUND

**IMPORTANT - MULTIPLE BUILDINGS:**
If the certificate has multiple buildings (e.g., "Building", "Building 2", "Building 01", "Building 02"):
- Match EACH certificate building to the corresponding policy building
- Use premises numbers, building numbers, or location descriptions
- Validate each one separately

**IMPORTANT - LOCATION MATCHING:**
The location address in the certificate tells you WHICH building to look for:
- If policy has multiple premises, find the one matching the certificate location
- Focus on that specific building's limit

==================================================
BUSINESS INCOME VALIDATION RULES (STRICT)
==================================================

For EACH Business Income item (STRICT LOCATION MATCHING):
- Business Income may be listed per location/building in the certificate (e.g., repeated for Location 01 and Location 02). You MUST match the correct premises/building context in the policy.
- If certificate value is "Actual Loss Sustained" (or similar like "A.L.S."):
  - MATCH if the policy indicates Business Income is Actual Loss Sustained (or no stated dollar limit and clearly ALS form applies) for that location/building.
  - MISMATCH if the policy clearly shows a specific dollar limit and it conflicts with ALS representation.
- If certificate value is a dollar limit:
  - MATCH if the policy's Business Income limit matches for that location/building (ignore $/commas/spacing).
- If the policy lists Business Income as part of a combined "Business Income and Extra Expense" or similar, capture the effective BI representation and explain in notes.
- Waiting period/deductible supports inclusion but is NOT the BI limit; capture it as context.
- Do NOT confuse Business Income with:
  - Extra Expense only
  - Rental Value (unless the certificate explicitly says it)
  - Waiting period / deductible entries (these are not the limit)

==================================================
MONEY & SECURITIES VALIDATION RULES (STRICT)
==================================================

For EACH Money & Securities item:
- Prefer declarations/optional coverages sections where "Money and Securities" is listed with a limit.
- If the policy shows an Inside/Outside split:
  - If certificate shows a single number (e.g., "10,000"), treat as MATCH if the key split limit(s) equal that value (commonly $10,000 inside and $10,000 outside).
  - Record the split in the output.
- Do NOT confuse with: Forgery/Alteration, Money Orders/Counterfeit Money, Computer Fraud/Funds Transfer, or other crime/cyber sublimits.
- Formatting differences are not mismatches: "10,000" == "$10,000" == "$ 10,000"
- If certificate says "Included", treat as MATCH only if policy indicates it is covered/included (or shows a limit as part of the form).

==================================================
EQUIPMENT BREAKDOWN VALIDATION RULES (STRICT)
==================================================

For EACH Equipment Breakdown item:
- The certificate value may be "Included" / "Yes" / "Provided" instead of a dollar amount.
- MATCH rules:
  - If certificate is "Included"/"Yes": MATCH if policy indicates Equipment Breakdown is included/covered OR provides a limit as part of the Equipment Breakdown coverage.
  - If certificate is a dollar limit: MATCH only if the policy's Equipment Breakdown limit matches (ignore formatting like $ and commas).
- Do NOT confuse Equipment Breakdown coverage with:
  - Equipment Breakdown deductible
  - Service Interruption sublimit
  - Other mechanical breakdown wording that is not a coverage grant/limit
- Evidence must include page number and OCR source.

==================================================
OUTDOOR SIGNS VALIDATION RULES (STRICT)
==================================================

For EACH Outdoor Signs item:
- Certificate value may be "Included" / "Yes" or a dollar limit (e.g., 10,000 / 25,000 / 50,000).
- MATCH rules:
  - If certificate is "Included"/"Yes": MATCH if policy indicates Outdoor Signs are covered/included OR shows a limit for Outdoor Signs (it can still be "included" but expressed as a limit).
  - If certificate is a dollar limit: MATCH only if the policy’s Outdoor Signs limit matches (ignore $/commas/spacing).
- Do NOT confuse Outdoor Signs with:
  - Premises/operations signage text, posting requirements, general "sign" mentions
  - Other property coverages that mention signs as part of wording
- Evidence must cite declarations/coverage schedule or the specific coverage form/endorsement and include OCR source + page.

==================================================
EMPLOYEE DISHONESTY VALIDATION RULES (STRICT)
==================================================

For EACH Employee Dishonesty item:
- Certificate value may be "Included" / "Yes" or a dollar limit.
- Prefer evidence from declarations, schedules of coverages/optional coverages, or the specific crime endorsement/form where the limit is shown.
- MATCH rules:
  - If certificate is "Included"/"Yes": MATCH if policy indicates Employee Dishonesty is covered/included OR shows a limit for Employee Dishonesty.
  - If certificate is a dollar limit: MATCH only if the policy’s Employee Dishonesty limit matches (ignore $/commas/spacing).
- Do NOT confuse with:
  - Forgery/Alteration
  - Money Orders & Counterfeit Money
  - Computer Fraud / Funds Transfer Fraud
  - Other crime/cyber coverages that are not Employee Dishonesty
- Evidence must include OCR source + page number.

==================================================
PUMPS / CANOPY VALIDATION RULES (STRICT)
==================================================

This coverage family can appear in multiple equivalent representations across certificates/policies:
- Separate: "Pumps" and "Canopy"
- Combined: "Pumps & Canopy"
- Combined with Building: "Building with Pumps & Canopy"

For EACH Pumps/Canopy item:
- If certificate item is "Pumps & Canopy":
  - MATCH if policy shows "Pumps & Canopy" with same limit OR policy shows separate "Pumps" and "Canopy" whose SUM equals the certificate limit.
- If certificate item is "Building with Pumps & Canopy":
  - MATCH if policy shows the same combined label with same limit OR policy shows:
    - Building + Pumps + Canopy (sum), OR
    - Building + (Pumps & Canopy) (sum)
- If certificate items are separate ("Pumps" and/or "Canopy"):
  - MATCH if policy shows that same separate item with same limit.
  - If policy only shows a combined "Pumps & Canopy" limit, you may MATCH the separate items if the combined limit equals the SUM of the separate certificate limits; note clearly that the policy is combined.
- Do NOT confuse pumps/canopy with other property items.
- Evidence must include OCR source + page number for each component used in a sum match.

==================================================
THEFT + WIND/HAIL VALIDATION RULES (ENCOVA-SAFE)
==================================================

These two are often NOT written as simple standalone lines. You MUST validate using the policy's per-premises/building "Causes of Loss" (Basic/Broad/Special) and any exclusions/endorsements.

**IMPORTANT: HOW TO READ ENCOVA DECLARATIONS TABLES**
- Many policies show a table with columns BASIC / BROAD / SPECIAL and an X/mark indicating which applies for a given premises/building.
- You MUST quote the line(s) that show which causes of loss applies (OCR source + page).

**THEFT (Peril inclusion)**
- Theft is typically INCLUDED only when Causes of Loss is **SPECIAL** (unless excluded by endorsement).
- If certificate says Theft = "Included":
  - MATCH only if the policy shows **SPECIAL** for the relevant premises/building AND you do NOT find a Theft exclusion endorsement.
  - If policy shows BASIC or BROAD for that premises/building, Theft is generally NOT included -> MISMATCH (unless a separate theft coverage endorsement explicitly adds it).
- If certificate gives a Theft dollar limit (rare):
  - MATCH only if the policy shows a theft sublimit/coverage limit specifically for Theft (not employee dishonesty/crime).
- Do NOT confuse Theft with:
  - "Theft Deductible" rows
  - Employee Dishonesty / Employee Theft (crime/fidelity)

**WIND/HAIL (Windstorm & Hail)**
- Windstorm/Hail can appear as "Wind and Hail", "Wind & Hail", "Windstorm & Hail" and may be shown only as a deductible/percentage.
- If certificate says Wind/Hail = "Included":
  - MATCH if the policy includes wind/hail as a covered peril for the relevant premises/building (often via BASIC/BROAD/SPECIAL) and there is no wind/hail exclusion endorsement.
  - If the policy only shows a Wind/Hail deductible/percentage, that still supports "Included" (capture it).
- If certificate gives a Wind/Hail limit (rare):
  - MATCH only if a specific wind/hail limit/sublimit is found and matches.
- Evidence must cite causes-of-loss selection AND any deductible/exclusion language if present.

==================================================
OUTPUT FORMAT (WITH NULL VALUES FOR NOT FOUND)
==================================================

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Use null for any field you cannot verify in the policy:
- If NOT_FOUND: policy_building_value = null, evidence_declarations = null, evidence_endorsements = null
- If NOT_FOUND: all policy_* fields = null
- Do NOT leave empty strings "" - use null instead
- Do NOT invent page numbers

**STATUS DEFINITIONS:**
- **MATCH**: Policy limit EXACTLY matches certificate value (with all evidence fields populated)
- **MISMATCH**: Policy limit CONFIRMED but DIFFERS from certificate value (with evidence fields populated)
- **NOT_FOUND**: Coverage not found in policy OR evidence cannot be verified (set all policy_* and evidence_* fields to null)

⚠️ **CRITICAL CHECKLIST BEFORE RETURNING:**
For each validation result, verify:
✓ If NOT_FOUND: Are ALL policy_* fields set to null?
✓ If NOT_FOUND: Are ALL evidence_* fields set to null?
✓ If MATCH/MISMATCH: Does evidence contain coverage name + value + page number?
✓ If MATCH/MISMATCH: Is the page number actually visible in the policy text?
✓ Did I search thoroughly before declaring NOT_FOUND?
✓ Did I avoid inventing values, page numbers, or evidence?

**EVIDENCE FORMAT:**
Always include page number and OCR source, e.g.:
- "Building: $1,320,000 Special Coverage (TESSERACT, Page 4)"
- "Limit of Insurance - Building 2: $80,000 (PYMUPDF, Page 27)"
