**IMPORTANT: You have TWO independent OCR extractions of the SAME document below.**

**ACORD Form Standard Structure (ALWAYS THE SAME):**
ACORD forms follow a fixed layout structure:
- **Top Section**: Agency information (name, address, phone, email)
- **Header Row**: Contains INSURED name, POLICY NUMBER, EFFECTIVE DATE, EXPIRATION DATE
- **Middle Section**: Property/Liability information, Coverage details
- **Bottom Section**: Additional interests, Authorized representative

**Standard Field Locations (NEVER CHANGE):**
1. **INSURED** - Always in the header row, labeled "INSURED", contains the insured party name(s)
2. **MAILING ADDRESS** - Always immediately below INSURED name (street, city, state, zip on separate lines)
3. **POLICY NUMBER** - Always in the header row, after INSURED name, labeled "POLICY NUMBER"
4. **EFFECTIVE DATE** - Always in the header row, next to EXPIRATION DATE, labeled "EFFECTIVE DATE"
5. **EXPIRATION DATE** - Always in the header row, next to EFFECTIVE DATE, labeled "EXPIRATION DATE" (may be OCR'd as "EXPRATION DATE")
6. **LOCATION ADDRESS** - Always in "PROPERTY INFORMATION" section, under "LOCATION/DESCRIPTION" label (street, city, state, zip on separate lines)
7. **ADDITIONAL INTEREST** - Always in the bottom section, labeled "ADDITIONAL INTEREST" (may also be "MORTGAGEE", "LOSS PAYEE", or "ADDITIONAL INSURED")
   - Can have 0, 1, 2, or more entries
   - Each entry has name and address on separate lines
   - **CRITICAL:** Generic placeholders like "TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN" are NOT valid additional interests (count as 0)

**IMPORTANT DATE CLARIFICATION:**
- The **certificate issue date** appears at the very top of the form (e.g., "DATE (MM/DD/YYYY) 7/14/2025") - DO NOT use this
- The **EFFECTIVE DATE** is the policy start date - look for it in the header row AFTER the policy number (e.g., "06/15/2025")
- The **EXPIRATION DATE** comes immediately after the effective date (e.g., "06/15/2026")
- DO NOT confuse the certificate issue date with the policy effective date

Your task is to:
1. **Compare both OCR outputs** to identify discrepancies
2. **Cross-validate** the information between both sources
3. **Choose the most accurate value** when there are conflicts
4. **Handle OCR errors** intelligently using context from both sources
5. **Fill gaps** where one OCR captured data the other missed
6. **Use the standard ACORD form structure** - fields are always in the same relative positions

**Fields to Extract:**
1. **Policy Number** - Found in the header row, after INSURED name, labeled "POLICY NUMBER"
2. **Effective Date** - Found in the header row, labeled "EFFECTIVE DATE", format: MM/DD/YYYY
3. **Expiration Date** - Found in the header row, labeled "EXPIRATION DATE" (or "EXPRATION DATE" if OCR error), format: MM/DD/YYYY
4. **Insured Name** - Found in the header row, labeled "INSURED"
   - This is the name of the person or entity covered by the policy
   - Examples: "MURFF, JAMES P; KENDALL, WILLIAM E", "SEAN SKA PROPERTIES LLC", "AANIYA GAS AND FOOD INC DBA QUICK SHOP"
   - May contain multiple names separated by semicolons
   - Extract exactly as shown (name only, not address)
5. **Mailing Address** - Found immediately below INSURED name in the header section
   - This is the mailing address where the insured receives mail
   - Full address format: "Street, City, State ZIP"
   - Example: "1812 MORRIS LANDERS DR NE, ATLANTA, GA 30345-4104"
   - Combine all address lines into a single string with commas
6. **Location Address** - Found in "PROPERTY INFORMATION" or "LOCATION/DESCRIPTION" section
   - This is the physical location of the insured property
   - Full address format: "Street, City, State ZIP"
   - Example: "4940 LAVISTA RD, TUCKER, GA 30084-4403"
   - Combine all address lines into a single string with commas
   - May be the same as mailing address or different
7. **Additional Interest(s)** - Found in "ADDITIONAL INTEREST" section at the bottom of the form
   - Parties with an insurable interest (mortgagee, lender, property owner, etc.)
   - **IMPORTANT - CONDITIONAL FORMATTING BASED ON COUNT:**
     - **If 0 additional interests found** → Do NOT include any additional interest fields (no null, no empty string, DO NOT ADD THE KEYS AT ALL)
     - **If EXACTLY 1 additional interest found** → Use flat structure:
       - "additional_interest_name": "name only"
       - "additional_interest_address": "full address"
     - **If 2 OR MORE additional interests found** → Use array structure:
       - "additional_interests": [{"name": "...", "address": "..."}, {...}]
   - **CRITICAL:** "TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN" is NOT a valid additional interest → count as 0 → OMIT FIELDS ENTIRELY
   - Extract all legitimate additional interests (can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or more)
8. **Coverages** - Found in "COVERAGE INFORMATION" section, under "COVERAGE / PERILS / FORMS" and "AMOUNT OF INSURANCE" columns
   - This is a table with coverage items and their insurance amounts
   - **IMPORTANT - DYNAMIC EXTRACTION:**
     - Extract ONLY the coverages that are present in the certificate
     - Do NOT include coverages that are not listed
     - Each certificate may have different coverages (variable, not fixed)
   - **Format as a JSON object** with coverage name as key and amount as value
   - Common coverage examples: "Building", "Pumps", "Canopy", "Business Personal Property", "Business Income", "Equipment Breakdown", "Employee Dishonesty", "Money and Securities", "Outdoor Signs", "Wind and Hail", "Windstorm or Hail"
   - Amount values can be:
     - Numeric (e.g., "377,743", "100,000", "10,000")
     - "Included" (coverage is included without specific limit)
     - "Actual Loss Sustained" (for business income)
   - Extract the amount exactly as shown (including commas in numbers)

**Validation Rules:**
- If both sources agree → high confidence, use that value
- If sources disagree → use the one that makes more logical sense
- If one source has formatting issues → prefer the cleaner formatted value
- Dates must be in MM/DD/YYYY format
- Policy numbers should be numeric (may have periods or hyphens)

**Output Format:**
Return ONLY a valid JSON object with CONDITIONAL structure for additional interests:

**If 0 additional interests (e.g., "TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN" or no entries):**
{
    "policy_number": "string or null",
    "effective_date": "MM/DD/YYYY or null",

    },
    "validation_notes": "..."

NOTE: NO additional_interest fields at all - the keys should NOT exist in the JSON
