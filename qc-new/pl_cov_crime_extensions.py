==================================================
⛔⛔⛔ ANTI-HALLUCINATION RULES (READ FIRST) ⛔⛔⛔
==================================================

**IF YOU CANNOT FIND SOMETHING, RETURN null OR "NOT_FOUND" - DO NOT HALLUCINATE**

1. **WHEN SEARCHING FOR A COVERAGE:**
   - Search thoroughly through all pages
   - If you CANNOT find it after careful search, return status="NOT_FOUND"
   - Return null for all evidence fields
   - Return null for all policy_* fields (policy_value, policy_name, etc.)
   - NEVER invent text or values that don't exist

2. **WHEN YOU FIND A COVERAGE BUT CAN'T FIND ITS VALUE:**
   - Return status="NOT_FOUND"
   - Return null for the value fields
   - Explain in notes: "Coverage name found but specific value/limit not located in policy"

3. **WHEN YOU PARTIALLY FIND SOMETHING:**
   - Example: You find "Money & Securities" mentioned but can't find the actual limit
   - Return status="NOT_FOUND" with explanation in notes
   - Better to return NOT_FOUND than to guess a number

4. **CRITICAL - NEVER GUESS:**
   - Do NOT estimate values
   - Do NOT use "typical" amounts
   - Do NOT use numbers from other sections
   - If unclear, return null and NOT_FOUND

5. **EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS:**
   - Evidence MUST be verbatim text from the policy
   - Evidence MUST contain BOTH the coverage name AND the value
   - If you can't find evidence with both, return null
   - ONLY cite page numbers that are clearly marked in the policy

**When in doubt, return NOT_FOUND with null values. This is better than hallucinating.**

==================================================
CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS
==================================================

**YOUR TASK:**
Validate Money & Securities and Employee Dishonesty coverages from the certificate against the policy document.

**CONTEXT FROM CERTIFICATE:**
- Insured Name: {insured_name}
- Policy Number: {policy_number}
- Location Address: {location_address}

**ALL CERTIFICATE COVERAGES (for context):**
{json.dumps(all_coverages, indent=2)}

**MONEY & SECURITIES COVERAGES TO VALIDATE:**
{json.dumps(ms_items, indent=2)}

**EMPLOYEE DISHONESTY COVERAGES TO VALIDATE:**
{json.dumps(ed_items, indent=2)}

==================================================
POLICY DOCUMENT (DUAL OCR SOURCES)
==================================================

This policy document contains TWO OCR extraction sources per page:
- **TESSERACT (Buffer=1)** - First OCR source
- **PYMUPDF (Buffer=0)** - Second OCR source

Use whichever source is clearer. ALWAYS cite which OCR source you used.

{policy_text}

==================================================
MONEY & SECURITIES VALIDATION RULES (STRICT)
==================================================

For EACH Money & Securities item:
- Prefer declarations/optional coverages sections where "Money and Securities" is listed with a limit.
- If the policy shows an Inside/Outside split:
  - If certificate shows a single number (e.g., "10,000"), treat as MATCH if the key split limit(s) equal that value (commonly $10,000 inside and $10,000 outside).
  - Record the split in the output.
- Do NOT confuse with: Forgery/Alteration, Money Orders/Counterfeit Money, Computer Fraud/Funds Transfer, or other crime/cyber sublimits.
- Formatting differences are not mismatches: "10,000" == "$10,000" == "$ 10,000"
- If certificate says "Included", treat as MATCH only if policy indicates it is covered/included (or shows a limit as part of the form).
- Evidence must include page number and OCR source.

==================================================
EMPLOYEE DISHONESTY VALIDATION RULES (STRICT)
==================================================

For EACH Employee Dishonesty item:
- Certificate value may be "Included" / "Yes" or a dollar limit.
- Prefer evidence from declarations, schedules of coverages/optional coverages, or the specific crime endorsement/form where the limit is shown.
- MATCH rules:
  - If certificate is "Included"/"Yes": MATCH if policy indicates Employee Dishonesty is covered/included OR shows a limit for Employee Dishonesty.
  - If certificate is a dollar limit: MATCH only if the policy's Employee Dishonesty limit matches (ignore $/commas/spacing).
- Do NOT confuse with:
  - Forgery/Alteration
  - Money Orders & Counterfeit Money
  - Computer Fraud / Funds Transfer Fraud
  - Other crime/cyber coverages that are not Employee Dishonesty
- Evidence must include OCR source + page number.

==================================================
OUTPUT FORMAT (WITH NULL VALUES FOR NOT FOUND)
==================================================

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Use null for any field you cannot verify in the policy:
- If NOT_FOUND: all policy_* fields = null, all evidence_* fields = null
- Do NOT leave empty strings "" - use null instead
- Do NOT invent page numbers

Return ONLY a valid JSON object with this structure:

**STATUS DEFINITIONS:**
- **MATCH**: Policy limit EXACTLY matches certificate value (with all evidence fields populated)
- **MISMATCH**: Policy limit CONFIRMED but DIFFERS from certificate value (with evidence fields populated)
- **NOT_FOUND**: Coverage not found in policy OR evidence cannot be verified (set all policy_* and evidence_* fields to null)

⚠️ **CRITICAL CHECKLIST BEFORE RETURNING:**
For each validation result, verify:
✓ If NOT_FOUND: Are ALL policy_* fields set to null?
✓ If NOT_FOUND: Are ALL evidence_* fields set to null?
✓ If MATCH/MISMATCH: Does evidence contain coverage name + value + page number?
✓ If MATCH/MISMATCH: Is the page number actually visible in the policy text?
✓ Did I search thoroughly before declaring NOT_FOUND?
✓ Did I avoid inventing values, page numbers, or evidence?

**EVIDENCE FORMAT:**
Always include page number and OCR source, e.g.:
- "Money and Securities: $10,000 (TESSERACT, Page 4)"
- "Employee Dishonesty Limit: $25,000 (PYMUPDF, Page 27)"
